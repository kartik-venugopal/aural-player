#  What's New in Version 3.5.0

## Improved Effects panel usability and aesthetics

### Pitch Shift unit

The Pitch Shift effects unit's controls have been redesigned to be more intuitive.

Previously, the current pitch shift setting was displayed as a fraction of octaves. Now, it will be displayed as octaves, semitones, and cents.

There are now also 3 separate controls to increment / decrement pitch in octaves, semitones, or cents, making pitch shift adjustment easier.

The main slider control's pitch shift indication coloring now originates from the neutral value in the center (0 pitch shift) to make reading its
indication more intuitive.

### Time Stretch unit

The Time Stretch effects unit's controls have been redesigned to be more intuitive.

There are now also 2 additional controls to increment / decrement playback rate in tenths and hundredths, making playback rate adjustment easier.

The main slider control's time stretch indication coloring now originates from the neutral value in the center (1x rate) to make reading its
indication more intuitive.

### Title bar area

The caption of the currently displayed effects unit has been moved up to the effects panel's title bar area. It is now consistent with the playlist 
window in this regard. This has also resulted in effects unit controls having more space and being less cluttered, improving aesthetics.
